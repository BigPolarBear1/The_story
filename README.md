Back in the summer of 2023, after living and working in Vancouver for over 3 years, I moved to the US, to work for Microsoft in Redmond.<br/> 
But there things quickly took a turn for the worst. Things like that time I was out running and some idiots began shouting slurs at me from their car.<br/> 
Probably because I'm transgender and those things began happening nearly every week as anti-trans rethoric reached a fever pitch in 2023 (the usual right wing anti-trans slurs like "creep","freak","weirdo" and even shit like "p*do").<br/> 
I became severely agitated and had a breakdown which resulted in me being put on administrative leave.<br/> <br/> 
A few weeks later I went for a run, and some people on the trial began saying weird things acting like I should have known who they are, upon finishing my run I had a breakdown again, became severely agitated at the parkig lot behind my apartment.<br/> 
While in this agitated state, I was again provoked by some guys in their car (they literally stopped their car on the middle of the road to start harassing me), when I walked up to them, they were waiting with a gun in their hand.<br/> 
And as I turned my back and walked away, the driver got out pointing that gun at me and shouting threats at me, he came after me for atleast 20 meters with that gun in his hand, making sure he had me in his line of sight... I remember just the pure adrenaline dumping as I was walking away, expecting to hear shots and die, I did not know who this guy was.. after what seemed like eternity he turned back to his car and drove away. I couldn't sleep for weeks after that, and it was during that time that Microsoft investigated  me for my earlier breakdown.. <br/> 
I just wasnt in the mood and mental space to talk to some investigator who was sending me fairly hostile corporate/legal emails.<br/> 
Honestly, from their tone, it was already clear to me they didn't have my best interest in mind and just wanted to fire me while avoiding a lawsuit.<br/> <br/> 
Then after Microsoft dropped the hammer and fired me I desperately tried to find a way to stay in the country, because for over 3.5 years, my entire life had been in the pacific north west, I had all my friends there, my entire support network, everything I had known. But being on a L1 visa, it was simply impossible. I talked to the FBI, to find a way to stay in the country.. but in the end nothing could be worked out, atleast nothing that realistically would have been feasable. And sadly I had also not gone for my PR in canada, which I would have been eligible for after living there for over 3 years... but I just didn't have the foresight. I was forced to move back to Belgium, move in with my parents. I tried applying to jobs for a long time... I had some interest from China.. and to be honest.. I probably should have just gone.. but I guess I was just heart broken to be seperated from my friends.. and moving to China wouldn't have brought me closer to them. I also got to hear from 0day broker in Europe that European law enforcement had been threatening them with sanctions for even talking to me... so I ended up stuck in Europe, a hostile place, where I couldn't get a job, couldn't find 0day buyers... running out of money. Then my bank also froze some of my financial assets right before the February market crash and began the procedure to close my bank account.. that decimated the last of my savings. At this moment, I have no money anymore. I have been living with my parents for over a year. I don't really have friends here... just every day alone in this room. Hearing less and less from my friends in the pacific north west as weeks go by.... there is just nothing left anymore. Everything good in life has been destroyed. I have no future. I'm 35, I have no pension contributions. I don't even a driver's license bc I was always hunting bugs and focused on my career. I am writing this, because I already know the outcome, and I want my story to be told. Because I remember back in 2018, how eager people were to portray me as a criminal or terrorist for dropping 0days. People want their villains, they don't see motive or nuance. Its a very dark world we live in. It eats people alive. The people who come out at top in this world are all sociopaths who know how to play the rat race. Good people, they just get screwed over. Back in 2019, a manager from Microsoft came to visit me in Belgium, when I was having a difficult time, and everyone in infosec was portraying me as a criminal (some even tried to dox me), he came to Belgium to talk to me, to be my friend. Eventually it led to a job interview and getting hired. After Microsoft fired me, they also fired that manager, claiming he gave me promotions I hadn't deserved... despite all the very critical bugs I had found in components such as secure channel (TLS) and OpenSssl. They not just ruined my life, they also ruined the life of the only person in this industry who really supported me, with actions, not just words. Them doing that to him,, after he had worked for that company for 27 years... I think that's what really pushed me over the edge. And that's what happened, the truth.

ps: I was already working on factorization for a few months by the time Microsoft fired me. They knew I was working on it. I even explicitely told the investigators sending me emails and told them I was threatened with a gun. These people have never respected me, they even downgraded a remote RCE bug in IKEv2 of mine to info disclosure, despite the fact that it had a stack buffer overrun with full control over size and contents (it was bundled with a handful of bugs, some info disclosure yes, but the deepest one was that stack buffer overrun) in any other world that bug would have been critical, and should have been, but they snuck it under the radar I guess. Just bullshit like that all the time. Or refusing to fix a bug, claiming it isn't a bug, in the tcpip stack, only to fix it later when a Chinese researcher years later reports that exact same bug. I ignored most of those things while I still had a job, bc I wasn't in it for clout or CVEs... but in retrospect, I should have seen the signs, these people they never respected me. Only my managers respected me. But Microsoft ruined the life of atleast one of them (the one who had hired me). Go to hell. Even if I succeed at my work, Microsoft gave me no other options then to make it public... and the day I succeed, my life is over anyway, insane transphobes and stalkers will make sure of that, not just my life, but also that of those around me.... and for that I am truely angry and that I won't forgive, not until the day I die.

People like to have strong opinions about everything I do and say. Tech bros with 6 figure salaries who do fuck all and arn't even that bright. And you're all such fucking morrons, because if you didn't spent all your time downplaying everything I do, then perhaps you would have predicted this chain of events, you people set into motion (at which Microsoft is at the center). I'm not quitting, I defeat factorization or I kill myself. One of two outcomes will happen at this point. And I know as time goes on I am only getting closer to succeeding. I am making real progress, even if you people are still in denial. Good luck with whatever the future brings, and give those incompetent assholes at microsoft my regards. I tried man. I fucking tried.

You people underrestimate my willingness to put my entire life, my entire future, to put everything on the line, for a longshot. It's not just that I like math, it's also just because it is the only way to finally get my point across. Because 0days obviously wasn't getting me any respect. I will grind this problem until the day I die if that is what it takes. I saw the shit you people wrote back in 2018 calling me some mentally unstable "t-slur" who must have stolen those 0days. I go hiking alone in the Arctic outside the normal summer hiking season, walk hundreds of kilometers alone through the mountains, sometimes going two weeks without resupply options (that's a lot of weight to carry including 4 season camping gear)... I don't give up. I keep going no matter the pain. This is why I win. This is why you people will keep underrestimating me, because you're all losers full with prejudice. You lost and I know I'm nearly there now. This is for my former manager, one of the only people in this industry who ever believed in me. Go to hell infosec and go to hell Microsoft. 

And lastly, yea, I struggled with intense rage after getting threatened with a gun, getting fired, losing my work visa, being seperated from the friends I had known for years... and some of those things I said I do regret deeply because being transgender, I should know better. I try man, that shit really fucked with my head, I still struggle everyday... I think if anyone threatens me irl, I will become extremely violent just because of all the trauma, there is days it is just too much, I still struggle sleeping, I don't even feel safe anymore in my own house, I sleep with a knife besides my bed, those events completely changed me as a person, I'm barely able to function normally anymore, I feel like a wild animal. Anyway... time to end this soon. Couple of days at most now. What the fuck does anything even matter. If I succeed, I will get endlessly harassed by stalkers and insane people, not just me, also my friends and everyone around me, if I fail, I'll probably kill myself. Go to hell for turning my life into a nightmare with no way out.
